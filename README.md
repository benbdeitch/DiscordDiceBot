# DiscordDiceBot
This is a simple WoD Dice Bot for personal use. 

The commands are !roll (n)d(m)[+|-]p, where n is dice amount, and M is die size. There are caps on the numbers, and it uses a free account on the base version of Random.org's free API. 
The variable 'p' along with the modifier are optional, and will cause the program to calculate the sum of the rolled numbers in edition.

Support will be coming soon to support multiple rolls of different sizes like '1d20+1d6'.
